# 🗺 Optimized Routes: Mar-a-Lago to Trump Tower  

## 📌 Introduction  
This project provides a **geographic analysis and visualization of optimized routes** between **Mar-a-Lago** and **Trump Tower**. By leveraging **geographic data** and **interactive mapping tools**, various routes are examined, and the distance of each is displayed through engaging maps.  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ Display of three different routes between Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower  
✅ Calculation of each route’s distance in miles  
✅ Use of **Folium** to create interactive maps  
✅ Geographic data analysis with **GeoPy**  

## 🔧 Installation & Requirements  
To run this project, you’ll need to install the following packages:  
```bash  
pip install folium geopy  
```  
Then, run the **Jupyter Notebook** file:  
```bash  
jupyter notebook optimized-routes-mar-a-lago-to-trump-tower.ipynb  
```  

## 🗺 Technologies Used  
- **Folium** 📍 for interactive map visualization  
- **GeoPy** 🌍 for geographic distance calculations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📜 for running the analysis and displaying results  

## 💡 How It Works  
1. A **base map** is created and centered between the two main locations.  
2. **Different routes** between the two points are calculated and plotted on the map.  
3. **Data analysis** includes displaying the distances for each route.
